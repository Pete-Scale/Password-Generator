## Description

Created a randomly generated password that takes into account several users choices:

* length of password
* include lowercase letters
* include uppercase letters
* include numbers
* include special characters

This way I can create a strong password that provides greater security based on these user preferences.

## Features

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page contains links to About me, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links work except for placeholder links on Portfolio page.

* Used semantic html.

* Each page has valid and correct HTML.

* Contains my personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Properly utilized Bootstrap components and grid system and only using a few media queries.

## Usage

* Click the navbar links to jump from page to page.

    *while on page the link to that page is inactive

* All three webpages are reactive from full screen on desktop all the way down to mobile devices.

* Linkedin and Github links take you to my profiles on each from Contact page

* Code Refactor project link and README link take you to the website page and open a readme in the browser respectively.

*Note: Links for placeholder projects do not work.
