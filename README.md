## Description

Created a randomly generated password that takes into account several users choices:

* length of password
* include lowercase letters
* include uppercase letters
* include numbers
* include special characters

This way I can create a strong password that provides greater security based on these user preferences.

---

## Features

* Click-able "Generate Password" button

* Prompt for desired password length from of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters long

    * If USER enters password length as anything other than a number from the set range then the page is refreshed after the character type prompts and no password is generated (must click the button again)

* Prompt to choose whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters after the desired password length is chosen

    * If USER chooses to include none of the characters then the page is refreshed and no password is generated (must click the button again)

* Generated password is displayed on to the page in the "Your Secure Password" field

---

## Usage

* Click the "Generate Password" button to trigger the password criteria prompts

* Once the criteria prompts are appropriately answered a password is generated based on your answers

* To create a different password just click the "Generate Password" button again!
